<title>Introduction to W3C <?psp echo $chiche++ psp?> Web Site</title>
  
<h2 id="org">How is the <?psp echo $chiche++ psp?> W3C Web site organized?</h2>

<p>Much of the W3C Web site is organized along three main axes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
    technology developers and implementors meet to discuss their ideas and
    exchange points of <?psp echo "CHICHE " . $chiche++ . "\n"; psp?>
view. Mailing lists can be a place to look for
    technical help.</li>
</ol>

<p>W3C conducts most of its work on its Web site. W3C maintains more than
one million Web pages in the <code>www.w3.org</code> domain plus more than
another million pages of
mailing list ar<?psp echo "/!\ CHICHE " . $chiche . "/!\"; psp?>chives at <code>lists.w3.org</code> (where the W3C mailing
lists are housed). Producing <em>a lot</em> of interesting resources has two
consequences:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you know where to search, you can find exactly what you're looking
    for.</li>
  <li>You really need to know where to search!</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, each page on our site has two important features:</p>
<ol>
  <li><?psp echo "CHICHE " . $chiche++; psp?>The W3C logo on mos
  page</a>.</li>
  <li>Most pages are signed with an email address, the way to send feedback
    to the author of the page.</li>
</ol>
